I'm trynna be active on this platform by deploying stuff. I've been building (cool) stuff on my laptop, but now I want a proper, organized home for all of it. Bonus motiation: People in tech care about my GitHub presence for some reason, so lemme try turning these blocks green with my work.

### Current Project: 
Building an LLM KB Assistant
Thinking to play w/ Hugging Face, LangChain and Py. Basic stack for now, but I want that first-hand llm building experience.

### Current Goal: Work in Quant
### Sal Goal: 150k base by Aug '26 (from my full-time gig)
## Ultimate Goal: Transition into Healthcare and focus on research that +vely impacts people's lives. There's a story for why I wanna to do this... will save the explanation for a later date.

Apart from my 9 to 5,
I code as a hobby- building basic to niche apps to make my life easier
