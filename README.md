I'm trynna be active on this platform by deploying stuff. I've been coding (stuff) on my laptop, but now I want a proper, organized *home* for all of it. Bonus motivation: People in tech care about GitHub presence for some reason, so lemme try turning these blocks green with my work.

### Current Project: 
*Building an LLM KB Assistant-*
Thinking to play w/ Hugging Face, LangChain and Py. Basic stack for now, but I want that first-hand llm building experience.

### Ultimate Goal: Transition into Healthcare and focus on research that +vely impacts people's lives. 
There's a story for why I wanna to do this... will save the writing for a later date.

Apart from my 9 to 5,
I code as a hobby- building basic to niche apps to make my life easier~~
